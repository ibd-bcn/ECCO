<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ECCO is to analyze RNAseq and 16S data to get some answers (mainly for a collegue).

The samples that start with V are the same as one in an old microarray on folder:
~/Documents/users/nuria_planell/np/users/isabella_dotti/pegs_organoides_2017

Note that the project on that folder is also rellevant for this data.
